##### Problem Statement

By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23. The path is denoted by numbers in bold.
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7 4 <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 2 4 6<br>
&nbsp; 8 5 9 3<br>
 </p>

That is, 3+7+4+9 = 23.

Find the maximum total from top to bottom of the triangle given in input.

<br>

##### Output Format 

For each testcase, print the required answer in a newline.

<br>

##### Constraints 

1 ≤ T ≤ 10 

1 ≤ N ≤ 15

0 <= numbers < 100
