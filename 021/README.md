### Project Euler #21: Amicable numbers
___

<br><br>

##### Problem Statement

Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n). 


If d(a)=b and d(b)=a, where a≠b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.


For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1,2,4,5,10,11,20,22,44,55 and 110 therefore d(220)=284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1,2,4,71 and 142 so d(284)=220.


Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under N.
